Overview:
iAtari800
- iAtari800 is a port of Atari800 to iPodLinux.
- Atari800 is an Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200
  emulator. There are two iPodLinux ports; one based
  on the SDL port using SDL and one written from
  scratch by Keripo using hotdog.
- ZeroSlackr uses the hotdog version as it is faster
  and has more features; the SDL version is for code
  comparison purposes (i.e. a SDL-to-hotdog example)
For more information, see:
- http://atari800.sourceforge.net/index.html
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_5200
- http://www.atariarchives.org/

Usage:
- FastLaunch through "Emulators > iAtari800 > FastLaunch"
  to start the "Dog Daze Deluxe" game or use
  "Emulators > iAtari800 > Disk Images" to select a
  disk image.
- Files with a ".atr", ".dcm" or ".xfd" extension have their
  default action set to iAtari800. Note that these are not the
  only file formats that Atari800 supports; see "USAGE"
  in the "Misc/Docs.tar.gz" archive.  
- Disk images/software should be placed in the "Disks" 
  folder. Free disk images/software can be obtained through
  the Atari Program Exchange (APX) collection found at
  http://www.atariarchives.org/APX/showindex.php?sort=pop
  Other commercial disk images should be dumped from real
  disks/cartridges, etc. (downloading commercial disk
  images that you do not own is ILLEGAL).
- Due to lack of input methods, the scroll wheel is used
  for joystick "start" and "select". For input mapping,
  see "iAtari800 ReadMe from Keripo.txt" in the
  "Misc/Docs.tar.gz" archive.
- Tweak the refresh rate, scaling, smoothing and COP
  setting through the "Emulators > iAtari800" menu for
  better gameplay.
